## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4 coarse phases derived from 33 requirements (Foundation -> Pipeline -> Handoff -> Media)
- Roadmap: Phase 3 (Handoff) and Phase 4 (Media) can execute in parallel since both depend only on Phase 2
- 01-01: RLS on junction table resolves through parent ai_agents.tenant_id via nested subquery
- 01-01: Bulk tag application uses Postgres RPC function for single-query performance
- 01-01: shadcn components created manually (no components.json in project)
- 01-02: Instance replacement strategy on PATCH (delete all + insert new) for simplicity
- 01-02: Unique tag constraint handled with 409 + field-level form error
- 01-02: Bulk tag apply uses two-step flow (GET count, POST confirm)
- 01-03: useRef over useState for savedAgentId to avoid stale closure in handleBulkTagConfirm
